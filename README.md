**ISSUES ADDRESSED WHEN RUNNING THE APP ON DEVICE**

If the project shows signing errors, then you can do one of the following:

1. Select the Project in Project Navigator> Select Target > Signing and Capabilities > Change the Team to Personal Team

OR

2. (This is more of a Hack than the solution if you have reached maximum App ID Limit) - Copy and Pase the bundle Identifier of the App which can still be installed and run in your device
